# PDW to DW1 model exporter
 A repository with code to try to port PDW models to DW1
 
 For now there is only a program to port animations from Pocket Digimon World to Digimon World 1
 Since the models/textures and sounds between PDW and DW1 are different, it does not creates any texture/sound data for the animations.
